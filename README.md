# Strux

*Start structured. Make it your own.*

Strux is a flexible foundation for building embedded applications on ESP32. It gives you a clean, modular starting point with WiFi, a web UI, OTA updates, and the infrastructure to grow your project without fighting your own codebase.

It's not a framework that forces you into rigid patterns. It's a well-organized starting point that you copy, rename, and shape into whatever you're building.

### The key separation

| Folder | Contains | Changes when you... |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| `hardware/boards/<name>/` | Pin definitions, the board's `BoardContext` class (owns all driver instances), `board.cmake`, optional `sdkconfig.defaults` overlay | Swap or add a board |
| `hardware/interfaces/` | Role interfaces the application speaks (`Led`) — small, application vocabulary | Application expects a new capability |
| `hardware/drivers/` | Board-independent chip/peripheral drivers implementing the roles | Add a peripheral |
| `strux/` | The framework: managers, dispatch, transports, settings, OTA | The template improves — pull it into a fork |
| `app/` | Your product: managers, business logic, commands | Add features or change behavior |
| `lib/` | RTOS wrappers, JSON, protocol, time utilities — the substrate all three layers use, part of none of them | Rarely — these are stable building blocks |

**Rule of thumb:** if the code changes when you swap the board, it belongs in `hardware/boards/<name>/`. If it's a chip driver several boards could use, it belongs in `hardware/drivers/`. If it changes when you add a feature to this product, it belongs in `app/`. If every fork would want it, it belongs in `strux/`.

Dependencies run one way: the board depends on nothing, the framework depends on the board's *nothing* (it never touches hardware), and the application depends on both. Anything the framework needs from the application arrives by registration — a command, a setting, a telemetry point — never by reaching upward. `app/LedManager/` is the worked example of all three edges at once.

### Boards

The target board is selected at configure time with `-DBOARD=<name>`. This repository has one, and it is the default:

| `-DBOARD=` | Chip | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `wt_sc01_plus` | ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R2 (Xtensa) | Default. 3.5" 320x480 ST7796 panel over an 8-bit i80 bus, FT6336U touch, 16 MB flash, 2 MB quad PSRAM, USB-C on the chip's native USB. No user LED — `BoardContext` binds `MockLed` |

The template's generic `esp32_devkit` and `esp32c3_supermini` folders were removed on 2026-09-16: this repository is the Comble host rather than Strux itself, and neither would configure any more once the root defaults began asserting PSRAM-backed NimBLE. The mechanism below is unchanged, so a second board is a folder rather than a refactor.

 Only the selected board folder is put on the include path, so application code just includes `BoardConfig.h` or `BoardContext.h` and gets the right one. The application never changes between boards: it compiles against the `BoardContext` class's surface, and each board makes itself compatible — with real hardware or a mock. Every board implements [`BoardProvider`](main/hardware/interfaces/BoardProvider.h), the list of roles a board owes, so a board that forgets one fails in the board rather than at some call site. To support a new board:

1. Copy `main/hardware/boards/wt_sc01_plus/` to `main/hardware/boards/<your_board>/` and edit `BoardConfig.h` and `BoardContext.h`/`BoardContext.cpp` (bind each role to a real driver or a `Mock*` one)
2. Add extra board-only source files to `BOARD_SOURCES` in its `board.cmake` (optional)
3. Add `sdkconfig.defaults` in the board folder if the board needs different flash size, PSRAM, or partitions (optional)
4. Build with `idf.py -DBOARD=<your_board> build`

Shared chip drivers (sensors, displays, expanders) go in `main/hardware/drivers/`, parameterized through `BoardConfig` constants so every board can reuse them.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [ESP-IDF v6.0+](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/)
- [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

Or use the included dev container (requires Docker + VS Code with the Dev Containers extension).

### Build & Flash

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py build                          # default board: wt_sc01_plus
idf.py -p COM7 flash monitor          # find the port, don't trust a number in a doc
```

The chip is selected separately from the board, and always will be: `set-target` picks the chip, `-DBOARD` picks the pinout, and a board's `sdkconfig.defaults` overlay cannot name the chip because IDF resolves `IDF_TARGET` in an early pass that does not yet see `BOARD`. With one board that means `-DBOARD=` is never needed; with a second it would be:

```bash
idf.py -DBOARD=<other_board> set-target <its_chip>
idf.py -DBOARD=<other_board> build
```

Switching chips rewrites `sdkconfig`. To keep two boards side by side, give each its own build tree and config:

```bash
idf.py -B build_other -D SDKCONFIG=sdkconfig.other -DBOARD=<other_board> set-target <its_chip>
idf.py -B build_other -D SDKCONFIG=sdkconfig.other -DBOARD=<other_board> build
```

If [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is installed, the frontend is built automatically as part of `idf.py build`. The React app is compiled, gzipped, and embedded into a FAT partition on flash. No SD card or external storage needed.

If pnpm is not available, the firmware still builds — you just won't have a web UI until you build the frontend manually (`cd frontend && pnpm install && pnpm build`) and reflash.

### Flash from Browser (no toolchain needed)

If you just want to flash a pre-built release without installing ESP-IDF, you can use the **ESP Web Flasher** directly from your browser:

1. Download the latest `Strux-factory.bin` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vanBassum/Strux/releases)
2. Open [ESP Web Flasher](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/)
3. Connect your ESP32 via USB
4. Select the serial port, set flash offset to `0x0`, and upload the factory binary
5. Click **Program** — done

This works in Chrome and Edge. No drivers or build tools required.

### Development

For frontend development with hot reload against a running device:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```

Vite's dev server will proxy WebSocket connections to the device. Edit React components and see changes instantly.

## Architecture

All managers follow the same pattern: they receive a `StruxProvider&` (or `AppProvider&` in `app/`) reference at construction and initialize via `Init()`. This gives you dependency injection without a framework.

```
Board (bottom — depends on nothing above it)
└── the selected board's hardware: LED, sensors, buses

StruxContext (the framework — answers StruxProvider)
├── ConsoleManager        — Captures ESP-IDF logs, broadcasts via WebSocket
├── SettingsManager       — NVS read/write behind typed setting objects
├── SystemManager         — Device identity, ping/info/reboot commands
├── NetworkManager        — WiFi STA/AP with retry and fallback
│   └── WiFiInterface     — ESP WiFi abstraction (swappable for Ethernet)
├── TimeManager           — SNTP time sync with timezone support
├── CommandManager        — Pure dispatcher for commands registered by other managers
├── UpdateManager         — Session-based updates to any partition by label
├── WebServerManager      — HTTP + WebSocket server, static file serving
│   ├── StaticFileHandler
│   └── WebSocketHandler
├── RelayManager          — Outbound pipe so the device is reachable off-LAN
└── TelemetryManager      — Measurements out through the relay

AppContext (the top — answers AppProvider, holds Board& and StruxProvider&)
└── LedManager            — Worked example; replace with your product's managers
```

### Boot sequence (main.cpp)

```cpp
Board board;
StruxContext strux;
AppContext application{ board, strux };

board.Init();         // hardware first: it depends on nothing
strux.Init();         // then the framework the application registers into
application.Init();   // then the product
```

That is the whole file. The order *within* each layer lives in that layer's context — `StruxContext::Init()` owns Strux's ordering, so a fork that pulls a new framework manager gets its position too. Hardware drivers live in the board's `BoardContext` class; application managers reach them through `AppProvider::getBoard()`, and the framework never touches hardware at all.

> **Looking for Home Assistant / MQTT?** That's deliberately not what Strux is for — [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) does HA-native devices far better. Strux targets product firmware with its own web UI and logic. (An earlier version shipped MQTT + HA discovery; it lives on in git history if a fork wants it.)

---

## OTA Updates

After initial USB flash, the device can be updated entirely over the web UI:

- **Firmware > Application Firmware** — Writes to the inactive OTA slot, then reboots into it
- **Firmware > WWW Partition** — Updates the web UI independently of firmware

The CI pipeline produces three artifacts per release:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Strux-factory.bin` | Full image (bootloader + partitions + app + www) for initial flash |
| `Strux-app.bin` | Firmware only, for OTA update via web UI |
| `Strux-www.bin` | Web UI only, for updating the frontend independently |

---

## WiFi Behavior

1. On boot, attempts to connect to the configured WiFi network (stored in NVS)
2. Retries up to 3 times on failure
3. Falls back to an open access point (`Strux-AP`) if all retries fail
4. Connect to the AP and access the web UI to configure WiFi credentials

---

## Settings

All settings are stored in NVS (non-volatile storage) and configurable through the web UI's Settings page. Each setting is a typed object declared in the manager that owns it and registered in that manager's `Init()`:

```cpp
// In your manager's header:
inline static StringSetting host_{ "myfeature.host", "My Feature Host", ""   };
inline static Int32Setting  port_{ "myfeature.port", "My Feature Port", 1883 };

// In your manager's Init():
strux_.getSettingsManager().Register({ &host_, &port_ });

// Anywhere in the owner — typed, no string keys:
int32_t port = port_.Get();   // NVS value, or the default if unset
```

The web UI auto-generates form fields for each registered setting, grouped by key prefix. Adding a new setting is a declaration plus a `Register()` entry — no central table to edit.

---

## Hardware Layer

The `hardware/` directory contains everything that changes when you swap the board or add a peripheral. It is split into `boards/<name>/` (one folder per target board, selected with `-DBOARD=<name>`) and `drivers/` (shared, board-independent drivers).

### BoardConfig.h

Each board has its own [`BoardConfig.h`](main/hardware/boards/wt_sc01_plus/BoardConfig.h) with its pin assignments:

```cpp
namespace BoardConfig
{
    static constexpr int LED_PIN = 2;             // GPIO2 on most ESP32 DevKits
    static constexpr bool LED_ACTIVE_HIGH = true;

    // Add your pins:
    // static constexpr int MODBUS_TX_PIN = 17;
    // static constexpr int SPI_MOSI_PIN  = 13;
}
```

### BoardContext

Each board folder provides a [`BoardContext`](main/hardware/boards/wt_sc01_plus/BoardContext.h) that owns every hardware driver instance (and bus host) and answers [`BoardProvider`](main/hardware/interfaces/BoardProvider.h) — the roles every board owes. Devices the application addresses by *meaning* go through small role interfaces in `hardware/interfaces/` — the included [`Led`](main/hardware/interfaces/Led.h) role is implemented by [`GpioLed`](main/hardware/drivers/GpioLed.h), and a board without the hardware binds a mock ([`MockLed`](main/hardware/drivers/MockLed.h)).

`BoardProvider` lists roles only. A driver whose *full* API the application needs is exposed straight off `BoardContext` as an escape hatch, off the interface — which is what stops the role list turning into the union of every board's peripherals.

This is where you add your project-specific hardware:

```cpp
class BoardContext : public BoardProvider {
public:
    Led& GetLed() override { return led_; }        // a role — on BoardProvider
    // TemperatureSensor& GetSensor() override { return sensor_; }

    // Concrete accessors stay OFF BoardProvider — only boards that have it need it:
    // Dps5020& GetDps5020() { return dps5020_; }

private:
    GpioLed led_{ BoardConfig::LED_PIN, BoardConfig::LED_ACTIVE_HIGH };
    // Ds18b20 sensor_{ oneWire_ };
    // Dps5020 dps5020_{ uart_ };
};
```

---

## Making It Yours

This is a template — copy it, rename it, and build on top of it:

1. **Rename the project** in `CMakeLists.txt` (`project(YourProject)`), `.github/workflows/release.yml`, and `frontend/src/config.ts` (dev-server host + GitHub repo for the release check) — the UI itself needs no renaming: it shows the device name and project name reported by the firmware
2. **Update `BoardConfig.h`** (or add a new board folder under `hardware/boards/`) with your board's pin assignments
3. **Add hardware drivers** in `hardware/drivers/` and instantiate them in the board's `BoardContext` class
4. **Add application logic** as new managers in `app/` — and delete `app/LedManager/`, which is only there as a worked example. Nothing in `strux/` needs editing to add a feature.
5. **Extend the web UI** — add pages in `frontend/src/pages/`, register routes in the sidebar
6. **Add settings** by declaring typed setting members in the owning manager and registering them in its `Init()` (see [Settings](#settings))

### Adding a New Manager

Almost always an *application* manager — see [`app/LedManager/`](main/app/LedManager/) for the worked example:

1. Create a new directory under `app/YourManager/`
2. Implement your manager class, accepting `AppProvider&` in the constructor. It reaches the framework through `services.getStrux()` and the hardware through `services.getBoard()`
3. Add it to `app/AppProvider.h` (forward declare + virtual getter)
4. Add it to `app/AppContext.h` (member, getter, and a call in `Init()`)
5. Register source files in `APP_SOURCES` and the folder in `INCLUDE_DIRS_LIST`, both in `main/CMakeLists.txt`

Nothing in `strux/` is touched — the manager announces itself by registering its commands and settings into the framework from its own `Init()`.

A *framework* manager (one every fork would want) is the same five steps against `strux/StruxProvider.h`, `strux/StruxContext.h` — member **and** a position in its ordered `Init()` — and `STRUX_SOURCES`.

### Adding a New Command

Commands are dispatched by `CommandManager`, but each command lives in the manager that owns its domain. Declare a static command table in your manager and register it in `Init()`:

```cpp
// In your manager's header:
RequestError Cmd_MyThing(CommandContext& ctx);

inline static CommandEntry commands_[] = {
    { "myCategory", "myThing", &InvokeCommand<&MyManager::Cmd_MyThing> },
};

// In Init():
services_.getStrux().getCommandManager().Register(this, commands_);

// The handler: declare every argument in one call, then write the reply.
RequestError MyManager::Cmd_MyThing(CommandContext& ctx)
{
    uint32_t times = 1;
    RETURN_IF_ERROR(ctx.readArgs(Optional("times", times)));

    auto resp = ctx.reply.object();
    resp.field("ok", true);
    resp.field("times", times);
    return RequestError::Ok;
}
```

Routes are two words (`category command`). `ctx.readArgs(...)` is not optional even with no arguments — it is what positions the stream at the request body and what lets `help list -category X -command Y` describe the command by re-dispatching it. The reply goes through `ctx.reply`, never by naming a wire format. The frontend calls commands via the WebSocket RPC layer in `backend.ts`, and the same commands are reachable through the relay; there is no HTTP command route.

### Adding a Hardware Driver

1. Define pins in the board's `hardware/boards/<name>/BoardConfig.h`
2. Create your driver in `hardware/drivers/` (e.g., `hardware/drivers/MyDisplay.h`), taking pins/buses as constructor parameters. If the application addresses the device by role, add or implement a small role interface in `hardware/interfaces/`
3. Instantiate it in the board's `BoardContext` class and expose it (role interface or concrete accessor)
4. Add component dependencies in `main/CMakeLists.txt` (IDF built-ins) or `main/idf_component.yml` (managed components); board-only source files go in the board's `board.cmake` via `BOARD_SOURCES`

See [`Led.h`](main/hardware/interfaces/Led.h), [`GpioLed.h`](main/hardware/drivers/GpioLed.h), and [`BoardContext.h`](main/hardware/boards/wt_sc01_plus/BoardContext.h) for a complete example.
